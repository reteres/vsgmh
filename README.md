	一场新颖的雨后，外出出门漫步。说漫步，也即是好走。渐渐走走，一来锤炼身材，二来观赏雨后时髦局面，接收露天陈腐气氛。
	24、爬山就像人生，再多的风景都将会只是过去。

35, again long way, step by step, also can go through, again a short road, do not stride feet can't reach.
Tonight, when a room full of sorrow occupies the domain of the loneliness when I have the moonlight, I then auxiliary opened the paper of the mind, but I can't put pen to paper, afraid of heart rain drenched all about you mood, again afraid the tides of memory overflow my heart sand bank dribs and drabs of my heart, heart is too messy to clean up.
